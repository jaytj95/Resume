        "Hello! My name is Jason John and I\\'m an Android Developer! I started learning Java when I was in High School and I continued my education through to college. I started attending the University of Georgia and I immediately started taking Java courses. After my first Java class in college, I started to apply my Java skills through Android development!\n\nIn the Summer of 2014, I took two internships, one at NCR Corp. and another at Harmonic Vibration LLC., a startup based in Atlanta, GA. At both companies, I took roles as Android developers, taking the lead role at Harmonic Vibration. My experience at these companies laid the foundation of everything I know in Android. I continue to work at Harmonic Vibration as a lead Android dev, releasing two Android applications which I\'ve solely written under them.\n\n As for right now, I took myself out of full-time school to get a jump start in my career as a developer. I\'m working with Harmonic Vibration in my free time and working as an Associate Automation Engineer at Cox Automotive/AutoTrader in Atlanta, working on a few ideas and startups that I\'ve developed over the years, all while taking online classes part time. Quite a lot on my plate for a 19 year old, I\'d say!\n\nIt\'s been quite the ride and I\'m loving it. I\'m always looking for a challenge. I\'m a young and hungry kid looking to develop something big."
